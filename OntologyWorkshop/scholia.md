Before we jump to the exercise, first a few pointers.
Scholia is a graphical user interface that visualizes data from the Wikidata knowledgebase.
Wikidata is a project under the umbreally of the Wikimedia Foundation and therefore a sister
project of Wikipedia [[0](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799684v1)].
Scholia uses web technologies to visualize the results queried
from Wikidata with the SPARQL query language [[1](https://riojournal.com/article/35820/)].

Like in the previous exercise, we start with an ontology code for `JRCNM01101a`: `ENM_9000086`.
